# Mobile-Price-Classification

This project aims to address the challenge of estimating the price range of mobile phones for a new mobile company looking to compete with major players in the industry like Apple and Samsung. The goal is not to predict the exact price of a mobile phone, but to categorize it into price ranges, providing valuable insights for effective market competition.

Problem Statement

Bob has launched his own mobile company and wants to compete with established companies in the market. However, he faces the challenge of accurately estimating the prices of the mobile phones his company produces. In a competitive market, assumptions are not sufficient. To solve this problem, he collects sales data from various mobile phone companies with the hope of identifying relationships between mobile phone features (e.g., RAM, internal memory) and their selling prices. As Bob is not well-versed in machine learning, he seeks assistance to tackle this issue.

 Objectives
 
1. **Exploring and Preprocessing Data**: Data exploration and preprocessing will be performed to understand the dataset and prepare it for modeling.

2. **Building Classification Models**: Various classification models will be constructed to predict the mobile phone price range based on the provided features. These models will help in categorizing mobile phones into different price ranges.

3. **Price Range Prediction for Unseen Data**: The trained models will be used to predict the price range for unseen data, aiding in estimating the pricing of mobile phones for competitive purposes.

Usage

This predictive model has the potential to assist mobile phone companies in estimating the prices of their products, enabling them to compete effectively in the market. Additionally, consumers can benefit by verifying that they are paying a fair price for a mobile phone.
